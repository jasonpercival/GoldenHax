Add a second Powerup to change another an attribute within Character Script and show this by changing the Sprite animation

    Powerup is anything Player can collide with, collect and be destroyed in game (adding something, health, speed…etc)

Add a projectile to the attack animation

    Projectile should be destroyed on impact
    Projectile should move and be fired in direction Character is facing

Use inheritance to create a base class Enemy that can be inherited from and modified to work with other Enemies

    With that class, create a second moving enemy using another asset not used in the in-class example
    Enemy should be moving at a different speed, different attack and should have a one hit kill by a projectile

Create a second Ranged Enemy (also inheriting Enemy) that fires Projectiles into the air and lets the Projectiles bounce on the floor

    Projectiles should be destroyed after 2 seconds not on Collision with the Ground​
    Projectile can damage Player on the Ground or in air​
    Time attacks so the Player can still pass through

Submit everything as one ZIP file that has the Unity Project Folder
